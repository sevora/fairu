An academic file indexing website.

## Overview
A file indexing website. Originally intended to index files in academia. It has a tagging function and a search feature. That's mostly about it. It also has a dashboard for admins to verify files.

## Sorry
Sorry for this useless README. I developed this website a long time ago and I just decided that I'll make the whole thing public at this time when I have basically not touched the code that much.
